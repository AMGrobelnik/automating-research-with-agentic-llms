IDEA FILTER ANALYSIS - COMPLETE PROCESS HISTORY

================================================================
STEP 1: EVALUATE SIMPLE, ELEGANT, GROUNDBREAKING - CHOOSE BEST IDEA
================================================================

Three AI research ideas were analyzed:

1. TOKEN-BUDGET AUCTIONS FOR MULTI-AGENT QUESTION ANSWERING
   Hypothesis: Auctions improve accuracy per token cost.
   
   Evaluation:
   - Simple: Moderate (auction mechanisms add complexity)
   - Elegant: High (principled economic approach)  
   - Groundbreaking: High (novel auction application to AI)
   
   Key concept: Use second-price auctions to allocate tokens among LLM agents based on self-estimated marginal value for question answering tasks.

2. CITE-AND-CHALLENGE PEER PROTOCOL FOR FACTUAL CLAIMS
   Hypothesis: Peer challenges reduce hallucinations and increase citation precision.
   
   Evaluation:
   - Simple: High (straightforward adversarial setup)
   - Elegant: High (clean peer review process)
   - Groundbreaking: High (addresses critical hallucination problem)
   
   Key concept: Use structured adversarial process where answering agents provide cited claims and challenger agent identifies unsupported spans.

3. SLOT-MEMORY BOARD COORDINATION FOR MULTI-AGENT TOOL USE
   Hypothesis: Fixed slots reduce chatter, latency, and errors.
   
   Evaluation:
   - Simple: High (clear structured memory concept)
   - Elegant: High (reduces coordination overhead)
   - Groundbreaking: Moderate (structured communication known, but slot approach interesting)
   
   Key concept: Replace free-form chat with fixed memory slots for multi-agent coordination in tool use tasks.

SELECTION CRITERIA ANALYSIS:
- All three ideas score well on simplicity and elegance
- Cite-and-Challenge scores highest on groundbreaking impact
- Directly addresses the critical AI hallucination problem
- Has clear, measurable outcomes with high practical impact
- Most feasible to implement and evaluate

CHOSEN IDEA: Cite-and-Challenge Peer Protocol for Factual Claims

================================================================
STEP 2: HIGH LEVEL WORKFLOW - CITE-AND-CHALLENGE PEER PROTOCOL
================================================================

CONCEPTUAL DESCRIPTION:
The Cite-and-Challenge Peer Protocol implements a structured adversarial review process for AI-generated factual claims. Multiple answering agents independently research and cite claims, then a specialized challenger agent identifies unsupported or weakly supported content. Answerers receive one revision opportunity to address challenges, resulting in higher-quality, better-cited factual outputs.

STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW:

Step 1: Claim Dataset Preparation
- Curate 300 factual claims requiring verification across diverse domains (science, health, history, finance)
- Each claim should be complex enough to require multiple sources and have potential for factual errors

Step 2: Multi-Agent Architecture Setup
- Deploy two independent answering agents with access to web search API
- Deploy one challenger agent specialized in identifying unsupported claims
- Establish standardized citation format and span-marking protocols

Step 3: Initial Claim Processing
- Answering agents independently research each claim using web search
- Each agent provides: cited claim with source spans, confidence scores, supporting evidence links
- Agents must mark specific text spans that require citation support

Step 4: Adversarial Challenge Phase
- Challenger agent analyzes both answers and identifies: unsupported claims, weak citations, conflicting evidence, missing sources
- Challenger provides specific feedback on which spans lack adequate support
- Challenger flags potential hallucinations with reasoning

Step 5: Revision Round
- Answering agents receive challenger feedback and have one revision opportunity
- Agents can: add new citations, remove unsupported claims, strengthen weak evidence, address conflicts
- No additional web searches allowed during revision

Step 6: Evaluation and Metrics
- Compare final outputs against single-agent baseline using same token budget
- Measure: hallucination rate reduction, citation precision/recall, claim accuracy
- Generate comprehensive logs of all interactions and reasoning traces

EXPECTED DELIVERABLES:
- Dataset of 300 processed factual claims
- Complete interaction logs showing challenge-response cycles
- Verification script for automated evaluation
- Result summaries comparing against baseline
- Open-source protocol implementation

The Cite-and-Challenge Peer Protocol was selected as the best idea based on its combination of simplicity, elegance, and groundbreaking potential to address AI hallucinations through structured adversarial peer review.
