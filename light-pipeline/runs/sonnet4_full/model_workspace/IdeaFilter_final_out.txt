HIGH LEVEL WORKFLOW: CITE-AND-CHALLENGE PEER PROTOCOL FOR FACTUAL CLAIMS

CONCEPTUAL DESCRIPTION:
The Cite-and-Challenge Peer Protocol implements a structured adversarial review process for AI-generated factual claims. Multiple answering agents independently research and cite claims, then a specialized challenger agent identifies unsupported or weakly supported content. Answerers receive one revision opportunity to address challenges, resulting in higher-quality, better-cited factual outputs.

STEP-BY-STEP WORKFLOW:

Step 1: Claim Dataset Preparation
- Curate 300 factual claims requiring verification across diverse domains (science, health, history, finance)
- Each claim should be complex enough to require multiple sources and have potential for factual errors

Step 2: Multi-Agent Architecture Setup
- Deploy two independent answering agents with access to web search API
- Deploy one challenger agent specialized in identifying unsupported claims
- Establish standardized citation format and span-marking protocols

Step 3: Initial Claim Processing
- Answering agents independently research each claim using web search
- Each agent provides: cited claim with source spans, confidence scores, supporting evidence links
- Agents must mark specific text spans that require citation support

Step 4: Adversarial Challenge Phase
- Challenger agent analyzes both answers and identifies: unsupported claims, weak citations, conflicting evidence, missing sources
- Challenger provides specific feedback on which spans lack adequate support
- Challenger flags potential hallucinations with reasoning

Step 5: Revision Round
- Answering agents receive challenger feedback and have one revision opportunity
- Agents can: add new citations, remove unsupported claims, strengthen weak evidence, address conflicts
- No additional web searches allowed during revision

Step 6: Evaluation and Metrics
- Compare final outputs against single-agent baseline using same token budget
- Measure: hallucination rate reduction, citation precision/recall, claim accuracy
- Generate comprehensive logs of all interactions and reasoning traces
