  "output": "Token-Budget Auctions for Multi-Agent Question Answering\nHypothesis: Auctions improve accuracy per token cost.\n\nMVP workflow\n1. Select 500 open-domain questions with a strict per-experiment token budget.\n2. Inputs: questions, simple web search, three diverse LLM agents.\n3. Method: second-price auctions allocate tokens by self-estimated marginal value.\n4. Output: answers with calibrated confidence, token cost, and source citations.\n5. Baseline: strongest single LLM with equal tokens; compare accuracy-per-1k-tokens.\n6. Deliverable: publish bids, allocations, prompts, outputs, scores, and scoring code.\n\nTerms\nSecond-price auction: highest bid wins, pays second-highest bid.\nMarginal value: expected accuracy gain from extra tokens.\nAccuracy-per-1k-tokens: correct answers per 1,000 tokens spent.\nCalibrated confidence: probabilities matching observed correctness rates.\n\n\nCite-and-Challenge Peer Protocol for Factual Claims\nHypothesis: Peer challenges reduce hallucinations and increase citation precision.\n\nMVP workflow\n1. Select 300 claims needing sources across science, health, history, finance.\n2. Inputs: claims, web search API, two answerers, one challenger.\n3. Method: answerers cite spans; challenger flags unsupported spans; single revision allowed.\n4. Output: final claims, citations, flagged changes, and explanation traces.\n5. Baseline: single agent with citations; measure hallucination rate and citation precision/recall.\n6. Deliverable: dataset, interaction logs, verification script, and result summaries.\n\nTerms\nHallucination: confident statement without supporting evidence.\nPrecision/recall: correctness of cited sources, and coverage of needed sources.\nChallenger: agent that finds unsupported or weakly supported parts.\n\n\nSlot-Memory Board Coordination for Multi-Agent Tool Use\nHypothesis: Fixed slots reduce chatter, latency, and errors.\n\nMVP workflow\n1. Select 200 multi-step tool tasks with automatic pass/fail checks.\n2. Inputs: tasks, three agents, six-slot shared memory board, simple tools.\n3. Method: agents write to fixed slots; referee prunes conflicts using rules.\n4. Output: solutions, slot histories, token counts, latency, and success rates.\n5. Baseline: free-form chat memory; compare tokens, latency, and task success.\n6. Deliverable: open-source board code, logs, and evaluation harness.\n\nTerms\nSlot-memory board: shared page with a few named fields anyone can edit.\nReferee: simple process that resolves conflicts and enforces brief slot rules.",

  "input": "Generate 3 novel groundbreaking research ideas in the field of Multi LLM Agent Systems.\n\nUse a <=10-word, self-explanatory title; immediately add a <=10-word hypothesis; then write a 6-step numbered workflow, each step a <=15-word plain sentence. Make the task narrow and measurable; list minimal inputs, the simplest method, the output, a quick baseline, and one auditable deliverable; after the workflow, add a tiny “Terms” section defining any non-obvious/technical words in plain language, using as few terms as possible.\n\nGood example:\n\nCausalify: forecast outcomes of actions from news\nHypothesis: Small causal maps from news improve predictions.\n\nMVP workflow\nState a single action→outcome or what-if question with place and timeframe.\nGather minimal inputs: few similar past cases, key numbers, and top articles.\nAI extracts cause→effect links from articles; keeps consistent links with citations.\nBuild a small causal map; fit simple rules from the data.\nSimulate the action; output probabilities, main paths, and short explanations.\nBacktest on past cases; compare to a simple baseline; publish one auditable file.\n\nTerms\nAction: something you choose to do (policy, event, change).\nCausal map: small diagram of causes and effects between factors.\nBaseline: simple comparison method, like a trend or average.\nBacktest: check if the method predicts past outcomes.\nCitations: links to the articles or data used.",
