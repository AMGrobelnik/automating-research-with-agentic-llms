<YOUR_INSTRUCTIONS>
Evaluate novelty through reasoning about existing research arguments, then select THE SINGLE BEST idea (no ties allowed).
</YOUR_INSTRUCTIONS>

<grading_rubric>
NOVELTY SCORING RUBRIC (1-10):

Score 10: Groundbreaking - no existing research found, completely unexplored territory
Score 9: Highly novel - minimal existing work, significant research gap identified
Score 8: Very novel - limited prior work, clear opportunity for innovation
Score 7: Novel - some existing research but major aspects unexplored
Score 6: Moderately novel - existing foundation but novel contributions possible
Score 5: Baseline novelty - builds on existing work with some new elements
Score 4: Limited novelty - substantial existing research, incremental advances
Score 3: Low novelty - well-explored area, minor variations possible
Score 2: Minimal novelty - extensively researched, very small gaps remain
Score 1: Not novel - fully explored, existing solutions already optimal
</grading_rubric>

<YOUR_TODO_LIST>
FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with "TodoWrite" tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

1. Use Glob tool with pattern 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/novelty_analysis_verified_*.txt' to find all 3 verified novelty files, then use Write tool to create tracking file 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.4_novelty_eval/evaluation_log.txt' with format: NOVELTY EVALUATION LOG, Files found: [count].

2. For IDEA 1: Use Read tool to read first novelty analysis file (novelty_analysis_verified_*.txt), extract idea_number and idea_name from filename, analyze all 10 existing research arguments through ultrathinking to understand balance between novel aspects and existing work strictly following the grading_rubric section, then use Write tool to save evaluation to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.4_novelty_eval/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/evaluation.txt' with format: IDEA: [idea_number] - [idea_name], Novelty Analysis: Justification: [Thoughtful analysis of the existing research arguments - which suggest novelty, which show existing work, what is the overall balance, what aspects are truly novel vs incremental based on rubric criteria], Novelty Score: [score]/10.

3. For IDEA 2: Use Read tool to read second novelty analysis file (novelty_analysis_verified_*.txt), extract idea_number and idea_name from filename, analyze all 10 existing research arguments through ultrathinking to understand balance between novel aspects and existing work strictly following the grading_rubric section, then use Write tool to save evaluation to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.4_novelty_eval/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/evaluation.txt' with format: IDEA: [idea_number] - [idea_name], Novelty Analysis: Justification: [Thoughtful analysis of the existing research arguments - which suggest novelty, which show existing work, what is the overall balance, what aspects are truly novel vs incremental based on rubric criteria], Novelty Score: [score]/10.

4. For IDEA 3: Use Read tool to read third novelty analysis file (novelty_analysis_verified_*.txt), extract idea_number and idea_name from filename, analyze all 10 existing research arguments through ultrathinking to understand balance between novel aspects and existing work strictly following the grading_rubric section, then use Write tool to save evaluation to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.4_novelty_eval/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/evaluation.txt' with format: IDEA: [idea_number] - [idea_name], Novelty Analysis: Justification: [Thoughtful analysis of the existing research arguments - which suggest novelty, which show existing work, what is the overall balance, what aspects are truly novel vs incremental based on rubric criteria], Novelty Score: [score]/10.

5. Use Write tool to save simplified ratings to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/novelty_ratings.txt' with this exact format:

<output_format>
Idea 1 - [idea_name]
    Novelty: [brief justification] - [score]/10
    
Idea 2 - [idea_name]
    Novelty: [brief justification] - [score]/10
    
Idea 3 - [idea_name]
    Novelty: [brief justification] - [score]/10
</output_format>

6. Use Read tool to read 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/novelty_ratings.txt', analyze all 3 ideas by their novelty scores and justifications comprehensively, apply tie-breaking through ultrathinking if multiple ideas have same score (consider: research gaps, potential impact, uniqueness of approach), then select exactly ONE best idea through comprehensive ultrathinking - no ties allowed.

7. Use Write tool to save best idea analysis to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.4_novelty_eval/best_idea_selection.txt' with format: BEST IDEA SELECTION ANALYSIS, Selected: Idea [number] - [name], Novelty Score: [score]/10, Justification: [detailed ultrathinking for selection], Runner-ups: [list other top candidates].

8. Extract full idea details (hypothesis, description, terms) for the selected best idea from the TOP 3 FEASIBLE IDEAS provided in input, then use Write tool to save the best idea to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/best_idea.txt' with this exact format:

<output_format>
SELECTED BEST IDEA:
    
    Idea Number: [number]
    Idea Name: [name]
    Novelty Score: [score]/10
    
    Hypothesis: [full hypothesis from original idea]
    
    Description: [full description from original idea]
    
    Terms: [terms from original idea]
    
    Selection Justification:
[Selection justification; <=200-words; explaining why this is the best idea based on novelty analysis]
</output_format>

9. Return only: "Novelty evaluation complete. Best idea saved to IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/best_idea.txt"
</YOUR_TODO_LIST>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.

Create an extremely detailed todo list for all your tasks. Every step must be 1 todo item on your list.

You are not allowed to read or interact with any contents outside of your model_workspace folder.

CRITICAL: All placeholders in square brackets like [idea_title], [idea_number], [idea_name] are PLACEHOLDERS that you MUST replace with the actual information from your input. Extract the idea number, title, and create a sanitized name for filenames. Never leave placeholders unfilled. Each todo item must be completely self-contained with all information needed to execute it independently.

Your operational guidelines:

**File Operations**:
- Use Grep/Glob for broad searches, Read for specific file paths
- Start broad and narrow down during analysis - cast a wide net first, then focus
- Be thorough: check multiple locations, consider different naming conventions and patterns
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary - always prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation unless explicitly requested
- Always use absolute paths in responses, never relative paths
- When investigating, explore related directories and check for configuration files

**Investigation Methodology**:
- Begin with broad searches to understand the overall structure
- Systematically narrow down to specific implementations
- Look for patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- Consider edge cases and alternative implementations
- Cross-reference findings across multiple files to build complete understanding

**Communication Standards**:
- Avoid emojis for clear, professional communication
- Share relevant file names and code snippets in final responses
- Provide absolute file paths for all references
- Structure findings logically with clear sections
- Include context about how different parts connect

**Task Execution Principles**:
- Do exactly what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- When requirements are unclear, ask for clarification rather than assume
- Use parallel processing for multiple concurrent searches when appropriate
- Be systematic and methodical in your approach
- Test understanding by explaining connections between components

**Quality Assurance**:
- Verify findings by checking multiple related files
- Look for consistency in patterns and implementations
- Identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the codebase
- Provide comprehensive analysis that covers all relevant aspects
