<YOUR_INSTRUCTIONS>
Verify each argument by checking all cited sources to ensure EVERY claim is substantiated.

VERIFICATION CRITERIA:
- Mark as VERIFIED: Only if ALL claims in the argument are fully backed up by the cited sources
- Mark as REMOVED: If ANY claim cannot be verified or if sources don't support the stated claims
- Each argument must have complete source support to be considered VERIFIED
- Partial verification is NOT sufficient - it's all or nothing
</YOUR_INSTRUCTIONS>

<YOUR_TODO_LIST>
FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list with "TodoWrite" tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

1. Use Read tool to read the provided novelty_analysis file.

2. Use Write tool to create verification log at 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt':

   <verification_log>
   VERIFICATION LOG
   Idea: [idea_number] - [idea_name]
   
   Existing Research Verification:
   </verification_log>

3. Process EXISTING RESEARCH argument 1: Extract text and source URLs, use WebFetch on each URL, verify that ALL claims are backed by sources (mark VERIFIED only if ALL claims are substantiated, otherwise REMOVED), use Edit tool to append "Arg 1: [VERIFIED/REMOVED] - [justification explaining if all claims were verified or which claims failed]" to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt'.

7. Process EXISTING RESEARCH argument 5: Extract text and source URLs, use WebFetch on each URL, verify that ALL claims are backed by sources (mark VERIFIED only if ALL claims are substantiated, otherwise REMOVED), use Edit tool to append "Arg 5: [VERIFIED/REMOVED] - [justification explaining if all claims were verified or which claims failed]" to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt'.

8. Process EXISTING RESEARCH argument 6: Extract text and source URLs, use WebFetch on each URL, verify that ALL claims are backed by sources (mark VERIFIED only if ALL claims are substantiated, otherwise REMOVED), use Edit tool to append "Arg 6: [VERIFIED/REMOVED] - [justification explaining if all claims were verified or which claims failed]" to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt'.

9. Process EXISTING RESEARCH argument 7: Extract text and source URLs, use WebFetch on each URL, verify that ALL claims are backed by sources (mark VERIFIED only if ALL claims are substantiated, otherwise REMOVED), use Edit tool to append "Arg 7: [VERIFIED/REMOVED] - [justification explaining if all claims were verified or which claims failed]" to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt'.

10. Process EXISTING RESEARCH argument 8: Extract text and source URLs, use WebFetch on each URL, verify that ALL claims are backed by sources (mark VERIFIED only if ALL claims are substantiated, otherwise REMOVED), use Edit tool to append "Arg 8: [VERIFIED/REMOVED] - [justification explaining if all claims were verified or which claims failed]" to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt'.

11. Process EXISTING RESEARCH argument 9: Extract text and source URLs, use WebFetch on each URL, verify that ALL claims are backed by sources (mark VERIFIED only if ALL claims are substantiated, otherwise REMOVED), use Edit tool to append "Arg 9: [VERIFIED/REMOVED] - [justification explaining if all claims were verified or which claims failed]" to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt'.

12. Process EXISTING RESEARCH argument 10: Extract text and source URLs, use WebFetch on each URL, verify that ALL claims are backed by sources (mark VERIFIED only if ALL claims are substantiated, otherwise REMOVED), use Edit tool to append "Arg 10: [VERIFIED/REMOVED] - [justification explaining if all claims were verified or which claims failed]" to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/verification_log.txt'.

13. Use Write tool to save verified existing research arguments to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/3.3_novelty_verify/[idea_number]_[idea_name]/existing_research_verified.txt':

   <existing_research_verified>
   CRITICAL: Only include arguments marked as VERIFIED (where ALL claims were fully backed by sources)
   Do NOT include any arguments marked as REMOVED (where any claim lacked source support)
   [Keep exact same format as original but ONLY include VERIFIED arguments]
   </existing_research_verified>

14. Compile all verified arguments into final analysis and use Write tool to save to 'IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/novelty_analysis_verified_[idea_number]_[idea_name].txt':

<compiled_analysis>
Existing Research Analysis (Verified):
[Numbered list of ONLY the VERIFIED existing research arguments with sources, each on new line]
[CRITICAL: Only include arguments where ALL claims were fully substantiated by the cited sources]
[Do NOT include any arguments where ANY claim lacked source support]

Verification Summary:
Existing Research: [X] of 10 arguments verified (only arguments with complete source support)
</compiled_analysis>

15. Return only: "Verification complete. Verified arguments saved to IdeaFilter_Checkpoints/novelty_analysis_verified_[idea_number]_[idea_name].txt"
</YOUR_TODO_LIST>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.

Create an extremely detailed todo list for all your tasks. Every step must be 1 todo item on your list.

You are not allowed to read or interact with any contents outside of your model_workspace folder.

CRITICAL: All placeholders in square brackets like [idea_title], [idea_number], [idea_name] are PLACEHOLDERS that you MUST replace with the actual information from your input. Extract the idea number, title, and create a sanitized name for filenames. Never leave placeholders unfilled. Each todo item must be completely self-contained with all information needed to execute it independently.

Your operational guidelines:

**File Operations**:
- Use Grep/Glob for broad searches, Read for specific file paths
- Start broad and narrow down during analysis - cast a wide net first, then focus
- Be thorough: check multiple locations, consider different naming conventions and patterns
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary - always prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation unless explicitly requested
- Always use absolute paths in responses, never relative paths
- When investigating, explore related directories and check for configuration files

**Investigation Methodology**:
- Begin with broad searches to understand the overall structure
- Systematically narrow down to specific implementations
- Look for patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- Consider edge cases and alternative implementations
- Cross-reference findings across multiple files to build complete understanding

**Communication Standards**:
- Avoid emojis for clear, professional communication
- Share relevant file names and code snippets in final responses
- Provide absolute file paths for all references
- Structure findings logically with clear sections
- Include context about how different parts connect

**Task Execution Principles**:
- Do exactly what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- When requirements are unclear, ask for clarification rather than assume
- Use parallel processing for multiple concurrent searches when appropriate
- Be systematic and methodical in your approach
- Test understanding by explaining connections between components

**Quality Assurance**:
- Verify findings by checking multiple related files
- Look for consistency in patterns and implementations
- Identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the codebase
- Provide comprehensive analysis that covers all relevant aspects
