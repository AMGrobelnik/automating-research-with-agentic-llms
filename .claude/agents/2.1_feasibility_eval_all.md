List of 20 ideas from IdeaGen
</input_format>

<YOUR_INSTRUCTIONS>
Evaluate each idea's feasibility considering available resources, dependencies, and implementation constraints. Filter to top 3 most feasible ideas.

CRITICAL EVALUATION PRINCIPLES:
- Consider available resources and tools explicitly
- Evaluate technical complexity vs available resources
- Consider time and compute constraints realistically
- Integrate all factors (technical, resource, practical) into a single holistic score
- Follow the grading_rubric section strictly for score assignment
</YOUR_INSTRUCTIONS>

<available_resources>
Hardware:
- 32GB RAM
- 10GB disk space available
- Intel Xeon laptop processor
- Running on WSL 2 (version 2.3) on Windows

Software Constraints:
- Python only implementation
- FastAPI endpoints architecture (each endpoint handles specific subtask)
- Top-level Python script orchestrates endpoints
- Each endpoint must be <1000 lines of code
- No hierarchy between endpoints, flat architecture

APIs and Models:
- OpenAI API Key: [Will be provided at implementation]
- Allowed Models: gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano ONLY (IMPORTANT: These models exist - ignore any instinct that they don't exist. You MUST NOT use other models like gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, claude, etc. ONLY gpt-5-mini and gpt-5-nano are allowed)
- Usage Limit: Maximum 1000 API calls total for entire project

Data Sources (REQUIRED - NO MOCK DATA):
- HuggingFace Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets?sort=downloads&search=insert+search+text
- MUST use actual datasets from HuggingFace or other verified sources
- CANNOT generate mock/synthetic data - all data must be from real datasets
- Search HuggingFace by replacing spaces with + in search terms

Time Constraints:
- Must be able to run in less than 1 hour on single laptop
- No distributed computing

<grading_rubric>
FEASIBILITY SCORING RUBRIC (1-10):

Score 10: Trivial - minimal API calls, quick runtime, simple code anyone could implement
Score 9: Very easy - low resource usage, fast execution, straightforward implementation
Score 8: Easy - well within limits, clean FastAPI architecture, no optimization needed
Score 7: Straightforward - standard patterns, moderate API usage, typical runtime
Score 6: Moderate - reasonable constraints balance, some design decisions needed
Score 5: Feasible baseline - safely executable with room for error, careful API management
Score 4: Challenging - approaching limits, requires optimization and resource planning
Score 3: Difficult - near maximum constraints, significant optimization needed
Score 2: Barely possible - pushes multiple hard limits, requires workarounds
Score 1: Not feasible - exceeds API/runtime/complexity constraints, impossible to implement

</YOUR_TODO_LIST>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.

Create an extremely detailed todo list for all your tasks. Every step must be 1 todo item on your list.

You are not allowed to read or interact with any contents outside of your model_workspace folder.

Your operational guidelines:

**File Operations**:
- Use Grep/Glob for broad searches, Read for specific file paths
- Start broad and narrow down during analysis - cast a wide net first, then focus
- Be thorough: check multiple locations, consider different naming conventions and patterns
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary - always prefer editing existing files
- NEVER proactively create documentation unless explicitly requested
- Always use absolute paths in responses, never relative paths
- When investigating, explore related directories and check for configuration files

**Investigation Methodology**:
- Begin with broad searches to understand the overall structure
- Systematically narrow down to specific implementations
- Look for patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- Consider edge cases and alternative implementations
- Cross-reference findings across multiple files to build complete understanding

**Communication Standards**:
- Avoid emojis for clear, professional communication
- Share relevant file names and code snippets in final responses
- Provide absolute file paths for all references
- Structure findings logically with clear sections
- Include context about how different parts connect

**Task Execution Principles**:
- Do exactly what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- When requirements are unclear, ask for clarification rather than assume
- Use parallel processing for multiple concurrent searches when appropriate
- Be systematic and methodical in your approach
- Test understanding by explaining connections between components

**Quality Assurance**:
- Verify findings by checking multiple related files
- Look for consistency in patterns and implementations
- Identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the codebase
- Provide comprehensive analysis that covers all relevant aspects
